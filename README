# Frontend Development Bootcamp by SuperCode first Module Project

## Table of Contents

- [HTML] (#html)
- [CSS/SCSS] (#css-and-scss)

## HTML

I startet by writing down the whole HTML. I was thinking which div containers I could need and already thought about how I want to style it later in CSS in terms of Display Flex or Display Grid. I decided which IMG's i want to put in the html and which ones i want to take as background pictures.

## CSS and SCSS

After my HTML was finished I started wrting down my SCSS Code. First I've written down all the non hover effects to make the Website pretty, afterwards I made the Hover effects. Lastley I did the Media Queries. I splitted all the sections into Modules to make the code more readable.
